# Canvas of Babel

A canvas where literally everything could be drawn and everything will be drawn.

## What is the Canvas of Babel?

The Canvas of Babel is a hypothetical collection of every possible image that could be made by a grid of pixels.

Every possible picture exists in this Canvas, from a picture of a dog to a car to Obama riding a unicycle in a circus. The original Canvas of Babel was a randomly generated array of pixels. Every time you look at this Canvas, it is *possible* that you will see some intelligible picture, but the overwhelming probability is that you aren't likely to see anything interesting before the heat death of the universe (though your brain will [try](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabelForum/comments/164amig/almost_looks_like_a_fly/)).

## What is this Canvas?

This Canvas compresses all possible outputs into a set time period to make it possible to see the full range within a human lifetime. Unfortunately, this means the canvas moves unbelievably fast. If you look at the top left of the image, you will see the pixels that are changing slowly enough to be seen by the human eye.

Below the Canvas is a place for you to upload a file so you can find out *when* your image will appear on the Canvas. Only a limited color palette is available to the Canvas, so your image will be resized and recolored to match how it would look on the Canvas.
